Hi, I’m @powersrob.

I am the Friendly Web Developer. I am experienced in web app development with over ten thousand transactions per day. With a smile on my face I build features, make tools and write documentation.

I enjoy long walks on the beach and clean code. I can deploy in several environments. Javascript and CSS are my jam. I like automation, animation, and gamification.
